## Project Title

I Challenge You

## MVP

- Create a Challenge Board application.
- Target audience includes teachers/students, friends/colleagues, anyone who wants to create or join a challenge board.
- I will use this application to look for challenges I am interested in and then join them and track my completion of the challenge.
- I will use this application to become a user, create or join challenges, setup a challenge with goals, timeframes, and prizes, and monitor  my and other users progress in completing a challenge.

## Fun To Have

- Administrator for the application who can see and manage all users and challenges.
- Scheme for awarding prizes for challenges or series of challenges.
- Opt out of a challenge.
- Let anyone define a challenge using a set of possible formats - goals with checkboxes, goals with multiple choice dropdowns.
- Scoresheet view for a given challenge.
- Progress report.
- Chat function.

## Setup Repository

- Use collaboration on GitHub and enable branch protection.
- Use issues and KanBan on GitHub.
- Use EsLint for Visual Studio Code, repository, and to enforce code quality before commits.
- Use Travis CI
